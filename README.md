moodle-adminreport-advisor_parent
=================================

moodle plugin 

This plugin will add a new option, Student Advisor to your Setting | Site administration | Reports menu.

The report will list all the accounts in the student role that have a parent or advisor role added to them or associated with them.

Adding a parent or advisor role to your moodle that can have context with another account is descirbed in the moodle docs at http://docs.moodle.org/23/en/Parent_role.

Creating the new parent or advisor or mentor (you can choose the name of the role) includes assigning it a user context.  This is very important.  Assigning the new role
the user context allows you to add/associate the role to a student account(s).

When the new role(s) are set up, you can add/associate them to many student accounts.  A parent, advisor or mentor can have one or many accounts associated to it.
